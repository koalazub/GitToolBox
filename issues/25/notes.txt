Probably there is mismatch caused by multiple repo events during update/merge/push
between branch hashes in RepoStatus and what is actually used during
GitStatusCalculator invocation.

Ideas to try:
1. capture first hashes for ahead and behind from rev-list command - these are actual branch pointers
    - schedule another refresh after some interval in case of mismatch
    - when still mismatch schedule another one etc.
    
2. use hashes from RepoStatus for rev-list
    - there must be some kind of refresh queue and current sort-circuit inUpdate set has to be removed
    - potential problem - could there still be some threading issue between what we get from GitRepoInfo and what some change that does not generate change event ?
     

First try second approach
